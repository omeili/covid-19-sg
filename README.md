# COVID-19 Cases in Singapore
This is a a consolidated list of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore as published in the press releases 1) by the [Ministry of Health of Singapore (MoH)](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19). The data is compiled from
* The press releases itself (discharged patients)
* Annex A (association of cases to clusters)
* Annex B (newly confirmed cases)

The data does (not yet?) include updates on incomplete cases.

## Differences in Statistics to Official MoH Data
The statistics published by the MoH is based on the release data of the information, rather than the confirmation date. As such when aggreggating the data based on the date, the results will be different than from the [MoH situation report](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

## Updates to Data
Currently the update is quite a tedious process due to two reasons:
* MoH unfortunately publishes all the data as PDF files only, even the long list of confirmed cases. As such the data needs a lot of manual cleaning as data extraction from PDF is rarely a error-free process.
* My laziness in building good scripts for the data cleaning and processing.
* The latest data includes all records until April 19. Thereafter the MoH stopped publishing detailed case data.

If you can/want to help with either of the above, please let me know.

1) Data before April 4 is taken from the [Straits Times article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore) summarizing the COVID-19 situation in Singapore and enhanced with MoH data later.
